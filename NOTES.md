# Dev Notes

* To use your locally saved h5 model, comment out the *.h5 line in .gitignore, and make sure to update the PATH_TO_MODEL variable in the code.


## Todos

* make basic TensorFlow model 
* generate off-manifold adversarial examples (e.g. fast gradient sign method)
* several manifold learning methods (e.g. LLE, isomap, Laplacian spectral embeddings)
* calculate similarity for adversarial examples
* recalculate confidence
